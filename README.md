![Build Status](https://ci.imjustdoom.com/job/crust/badge/icon)

Crust is a custom Minecraft server software I am/was creating to learn packets and just have fun with. Doubt this will ever become a thing

A lot of code taken from [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom) and [Dripleaf](https://github.com/NoahvdAa/Dripleaf), also helped with this by the main dev of [Krypton](https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton)
