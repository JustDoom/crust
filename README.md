Crust is a custom Minecraft server software I am/was creating to learn packets and just have fun with. Doubt this will ever become stable enough for production but it has been very fun to work on.

A lot of code taken from [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom) and [Dripleaf](https://github.com/NoahvdAa/Dripleaf), also helped with this by the main dev of [Krypton](https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton).

# TODO:
- [x] Respond to the server list ping
- [x] Logging in
- [ ] Joining a world on login
- [ ] Authentication with Mojang servers
- [ ] A server.properties file
